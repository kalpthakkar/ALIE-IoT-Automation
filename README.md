## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Device boots up** and connects to WiFi (ad-hoc or WAN).
2. **Sensors and relays** are initialized; FreeRTOS tasks manage device logic.
3. **User interacts** via web/mobile/voice/touch/BCI.
4. **Commands are processed** locally or sent securely to the cloud (Firebase).
5. **Device state is updated** in real-time across all interfaces.
6. **Scheduling, automation, and alerts** are handled via cloud and local logic.
7. **OTA updates** and error handling ensure reliability and security.

---

## üß© Workflow

1. **Setup:** Device is configured via web/mobile interface or NFC.
2. **Control:** User can control appliances, monitor sensors, and schedule tasks.
3. **Sync:** All changes are synced with Firebase for remote access and backup.
4. **Automation:** Scheduled events and smart triggers automate environment.
5. **Monitoring:** Real-time dashboard provides immersive visualization and alerts.
6. **Energy Saving:** Device enters deep sleep when idle, wakes on event.

## üì¶ Setup & Installation

### Hardware

1. Assemble ESP32, relays, sensors, and optional NFC/RFID modules.
2. Print and assemble the custom casing ([see images/hardware/](images/hardware/)).
3. Power up the device.

### Firmware

1. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) in VSCode.
2. Clone this repo and open in VSCode.
3. Configure `platformio.ini` as needed.
4. Build and upload firmware to ESP32:
   ```sh
   pio run --target upload
   ```
5. Monitor serial output for debugging and configuration info:
   ```sh
   pio device monitor
   ```

### Configuration

- Edit `src/config/app_config.h` to set up WiFi, Firebase, and other parameters.
- Use `src/config/wifi_config.h` for WiFi credentials (SSID, password).
- Configure Firebase in the Firebase console; download `google-services.json` and place it in the `src` directory.

---

## üìö Usage

- **Web Interface:** Access the 3D dashboard, control devices, and monitor status at `http://<device_ip>`.
- **Mobile App:** Use the Blynk app to control devices and receive notifications.
- **Voice Control:** Integrate with Alexa or Google Home for voice commands.
- **Touch Control:** Use the touch sensors on the device for local control.
